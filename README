Homework 3 by James Nichols

In light of changes to my project idea, I've also changed what scene I'm
displaying. This time it's meant to look like a carnival target game. Controls:

Arrow keys: look up, left, down, and right
s: toggle light movement
esc: exit program

Images converted with GIMP
Texture Sources:
crate.bmp: example
darkwood.bmp: https://www.the3rdsequence.com/texturedb/texture/13/dark+parquet/
medwood.bmp: https://www.the3rdsequence.com/texturedb/texture/45/dark+wood+parquet/
hay.bmp: https://www.the3rdsequence.com/texturedb/texture/14/+hay+straw/
target.bmp: homemade

Time spent: 35 hrs

A few notes:
I tried to make it work on more of an inheritance basis than last time. This
presented some issues I didn't see coming at first so I'm going to go with
a different approach for the final product, in addition to switching over
to SDL.
